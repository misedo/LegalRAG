    "text": "Convicted of murder in connection with the stabbing death of the victim, the defendant's former girlfriend, the defendant appealed to this court. Prior to trial, the trial court denied in part the defendant's motion to introduce third-party culpability evidence relating to the victim's neighbor, A. The trial court specifically excluded a video that A had sent to the victim and related text messages, a voicemail that A had left for his girlfriend after the police interviewed him about the victim's murder, evidence of A's prior misconduct, and evidence of a decline in A's mental health in the weeks following the victim's murder. The defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court had abused its discretion in excluding the foregoing evidence and that its exclu- sion violated his constitutional rights to due process, to present a complete defense, and to confrontation. Held: Even if this court assumed that the trial court had abused its discretion in excluding the proffered evidence, any error was evidentiary rather than constitutional in nature, and the defendant failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. Any claimed error in the exclusion of the proffered evidence did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional rights because, even though the excluded evidence concerned A's relationship with the victim and his behavior follow- ing the murder, it was not central to the defendant's third-party culpability defense, and the defendant nevertheless was able to present to the jury substantial evidence and argument in support of that defense. Moreover, this court had a fair assurance that the trial court's exclusion of the proffered evidence did not affect the jury's verdict given the overall strength of the state's case and the weakness of the defendant's third-party culpability defense, and the fact that most of the evidence supporting the defendant's third-party culpability defense was admitted and considered by the jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor asked a police detective during redirect examination whether defense attorneys generally have an opportunity to review evidence and to request that it be sent to the state forensic science laboratory for testing and whether he had received such a request from defense counsel in this particular case. Although the defendant claimed that the prosecutor had improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defense and that this impropriety denied him of a fair trial, the defendant failed to demonstrate that the prosecutor's questions were prejudicial in light of the entire trial, as they did not suggest that the defense was obligated to submit evidence to the state forensic science laboratory for testing, and the trial court, in its initial, curative, and final instructions to the jury, made clear that the state had the burden of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. USCA4 Appeal: 23-1733 Doc: 46 Filed: 08/08/2025 Pg: 2 of 14 PER CURIAM: Erica Chambers was driving with her two minor children on the highway in North Carolina when they were hit by a truck owned by Big Boss Construction, Inc. After bringing suit against Big Boss and several other parties involved in the accident, Chambers filed a declaratory judgment action to establish that Big Boss\u2019s $2 million commercial excess insurance policy\u2014issued by Harford Mutual Insurance Group, Inc.\u2014provided coverage for the accident. The district court sided with Chambers and concluded that the accident fell within the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage. The district court further determined that Chambers and her children were entitled to pre- and post-judgment interest under the policy. We affirm both rulings. I. Background 1 On October 27, 2018, Erica Chambers and her children were severely injured in an automobile accident as they drove south on North Carolina Highway 49. A truck owned by Big Boss Construction, Inc. crossed the center of the highway and struck Chambers head on. The driver of the truck was unauthorized to operate a motor vehicle, as he lacked a valid driver\u2019s license. The parties agree that at the time of the accident, the driver was an agent of Big Boss acting within the scope of his employment. The driver was on his way 1 In the litigation agreement discussed infra, the parties \u201cagree[d] that all facts and conclusions of law pled in the Second Amended Complaint in the Underlying Litigation are deemed admitted\u201d for the purpose of this declaratory judgment action. J.A. 207. We thus recite the facts as alleged in that complaint. 2 USCA4 Appeal: 23-1733 Doc: 46 Filed: 08/08/2025 Pg: 3 of 14 to complete a job for a different company, NC Champions Construction, Inc., which",

The district court sentenced him to a term of 63 months\u2019 imprisonment and two years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), stating there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Stull\u2019s sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider Stull\u2019s arguments for a downward variance. Stull filed a pro se supplemental brief raising additional issues. * We directed the parties to submit merits briefs addressing (1) whether the district court plainly erred in failing to inform Stull of the maximum possible penalty during his plea colloquy, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 11; and (2) whether the district court provided Stull a sufficient opportunity to allocute and provide any information to mitigate his sentence during his sentencing, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii). For the following reasons, we affirm. Because Stull did not move to withdraw his plea in the district court, we review for plain error. United States v. Sanya, 774 F.3d 812, 815 (4th Cir. 2014). \u201cUnder the plain error standard, [we] will correct an unpreserved error if (1) an error was made; (2) the error is plain; (3) the error affects substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d United States v. Harris, 890 F.3d 480, 491 (4th Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the guilty plea We have considered the arguments raised in Stull\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and * conclude they lack merit. 2 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4340 Doc: 29 Filed: 08/08/2025 Pg: 3 of 6 context, a defendant establishes that an error affected his substantial rights by showing \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d United States v.

Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. USCA4 Appeal: 24-4515 Doc: 34 Filed: 08/08/2025 Pg: 2 of 3 PER CURIAM: Marcus Stokes pleaded guilty to the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and was sentenced to a 57-month term of imprisonment, a sentence at the low end of his Guidelines\u2019 range. He now challenges his conviction as unconstitutional under New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1 (2022), and his sentence as procedurally and substantively unreasonable. As even Stokes acknowledges in briefing, his facial and as-applied challenges to \u00a7 922(g)(1)\u2019s constitutionality are squarely foreclosed by our decisions in United States v. Canada, 123 F.4th 159 (4th Cir. 2024), and United States v. Hunt, 123 F.4th 697 (4th Cir. 2024). See McMellon v. United States, 387 F.3d 329, 332 (4th Cir. 2004) (recognizing \u201cthe basic principle that one panel cannot overrule a decision issued by another panel\u201d). So we do not disturb his conviction. We do not disturb his sentence either. We review his sentence for abuse of discretion. United States v. Elboghdady, 117 F.4th 224, 233\u201334 (4th Cir. 2024) (citing Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007)). As relevant here, \u201c[a]ny sentence that is within or below a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable,\u201d and that \u201cpresumption can only be rebutted by showing that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d United States v. Louthian, 756 F.3d 295, 306 (4th Cir. 2014). Stokes received a sentence at the low end of his Guidelines range here and he fails to rebut its presumptive reasonableness.

Atchue Deputy Clerk Page 2 KAREN LECRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge, statement respecting the denial of a stay pending appeal: Throughout the 1600s, the Stuart monarchs engaged in a titanic struggle with Parliament regarding who would reign supreme over the public purse. That struggle was marked by civil war, regicide and a new wellspring of liberty in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. By the end of the upheaval, Parliament emerged supreme in matters of taxation and spending. Our Constitution followed suit, granting the Congress plenary control over the public fisc. Recently, the Executive has once again locked horns in a struggle for control over the purse strings. Across a slew of cases, recipients of congressional funding have challenged the President\u2019s ability to unilaterally freeze or \u201cimpound\u201d spending.1 Today\u2019s case is but the latest chapter in the ongoing saga. 1 See, e.g., AIDS Vaccine Advoc.

We conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus. 1 See TEX. R. APP. P. 52.8(d) (\u201cWhen denying relief, the court may hand down an opinion but is not required to do so. When granting relief, the court must hand down an opinion as in any other case.\u201d); id. R. 47.1 (requiring the appellate courts to \u201chand down a written opinion that is as brief as practicable but that addresses every issue raised and necessary to final disposition\u201d); id. R. 47.4 (distinguishing opinions and memorandum opinions). 2 This original proceeding arises from trial court cause number CL-23-4262-J in the County Court at Law No. 10 of Hidalgo County, Texas, and the respondent is the Honorable Armando J. Marroquin. See id. R. 52.2. I. BACKGROUND Real party in interest Jose Chapa made a claim under his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, issued by Germania, for storm-related damage sustained to his property. After investigating Chapa\u2019s claim, Germania concluded that the amount of the covered damages did not exceed Chapa\u2019s policy deductible of $9,500. Thereafter, Chapa invoked appraisal under his insurance policy and selected Rick Guerra-Prats as his appraiser. In turn, Germania chose Robert Stephenson as its appraiser. The appraisers did not agree as to the value of Chapa\u2019s property damages. Chapa subsequently filed the underlying lawsuit against Germania alleging claims for breach of contract, violations of the Texas Insurance Code and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. In the litigation, Germania filed a motion to compel appraisal, and the trial court granted that motion. Ultimately, the American Arbitration Association (AAA) appointed Jason Spencer as the umpire for the dispute. Spencer entered an appraisal award of $8,976, consistent with the value of the claim as determined by Germania\u2019s appraiser. Germania did not pay the award because it was less than Chapa\u2019s $9,500 deductible. Spencer and Stephenson signed the appraisal award, but Guerra-Prats did not. Chapa filed a motion to set aside the appraisal award. Chapa argued that: (1) the appraisal award was issued without authority; (2) the award was premised on mistake or accident; (3) the award failed to comply with the insurance policy; and (4) the award did not represent an honest appraisal of the damages. Chapa did not provide affidavits in support of his motion to set aside the appraisal award but did attach the insurance policy; claims correspondence; communications between members of th",

    "text": "NUMBER 13-24-00361-CV COURT OF APPEALS THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS CORPUS CHRISTI \u2013 EDINBURG CITY OF MCALLEN, Appellant, v. FRANCISCO J. GONZALEZ, Appellee. ON APPEAL FROM THE COUNTY COURT AT LAW NO. 1 OF HIDALGO COUNTY, TEXAS MEMORANDUM OPINION Before Chief Justice Tijerina and Justices West and Fonseca Memorandum Opinion by Justice West Appellant City of McAllen (the City) appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of its plea to the jurisdiction and motions for summary judgment. By its sole issue, the City argues the trial court erred because appellee Francisco J. Gonzalez failed to establish a valid waiver of governmental immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA). See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 101.021(1)(A). We reverse and remand. I. BACKGROUND Gonzalez filed suit against the City asserting a claim for negligence under \u00a7 101.021 of the TTCA. Id. Gonzalez alleged that Jocelyn Reyes, a police officer employed by the City, ran a red light without stopping or determining whether it was safe to proceed, resulting in a collision with his car and injuries to his person. After some discovery, the City filed, in one motion, a plea to the jurisdiction, a no- evidence motion for summary judgment, and a traditional motion for summary judgment. It asserted that it had governmental immunity because the exception to TTCA \u00a7 101.021 withdraws waiver of immunity where an officer is responding to an emergency call and avoids violating the law or acting recklessly. See id. \u00a7 101.055(2). On appeal, both parties rely on a traffic camera video, a dash-cam video, and Officer Reyes\u2019s deposition. This evidence demonstrates that Officer Reyes was on duty and received a dispatch call for a possible drug overdose. She advised dispatch that she was responding, and dispatch acknowledged her. She testified that she activated emergency lights and sirens. The dash-cam and traffic cameras captured Officer Reyes as she approached a red light at an intersection. The dash-cam footage shows that Officer Reyes\u2019s lights were on. It also recorded a sound that the parties agreed was a siren, the intermittent use of a horn, and reduction of the cruiser\u2019s speed from around eighty miles per hour to four miles per hour when entering the middle of the intersection. In the footage, vehicles are observed moving out of Officer Reyes\u2019s path and stopping. As Officer Reyes attempted to cross the last lane of perpendicular traffic, an SUV driven by Gonzalez collided with her cruiser. Shortly after the collision, a large tour bus entered the traffic 2 camera footage from the same direction as Gonzalez\u2019s car. Gonzalez asserts that the bus obstructed both his view and Officer Reyes\u2019s view of each other. The trial court denied the City\u2019s motion, and this interlocutory appeal followed. II. DISCUSSION The City argues that Gonzalez failed to establish the City\u2019s waiver of immunity under the TTCA because it failed to present fact issues negating the exceptions to the state\u2019s immunity waiver found i",

ON APPEAL FROM THE 36TH DISTRICT COURT OF SAN PATRICIO COUNTY, TEXAS MEMORANDUM OPINION Before Justices Silva, Pe\u00f1a, and Cron Memorandum Opinion by Justice Pe\u00f1a The cause is before the Court on its own motion and appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. On May 9, 2025, appellant filed a notice of appeal attempting to appeal an Order entered in trial court case number S-20-3100-CR. The trial court\u2019s certification of the defendant\u2019s right of appeal provides that this \u201cis not a plea-bargain case, and the defendant has the limited right of appeal.\u201d On May 12, 2025, the Clerk of the Court notified appellant that it appears the order he was attempting to appeal is not appealable. On May 23, 2025, the Clerk of the Court again notified appellant of the defective notice of appeal; appellant was further notified that if the defect was not cured within thirty days from the date of the notice the appeal may be dismissed. On July 21, 2025, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss which did not comply with the requirement that such a motion be signed by both counsel and appellant. See TEX. R. APP. P. 42.2(a). In a criminal appeal, \u201c[t]he standard for determining jurisdiction is not whether the appeal is precluded by law, but whether the appeal is authorized by law.\u201d Abbott v. State, 271 S.W.3d 694, 696\u201397 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); see State ex rel. Lykos v. Fine, 330 S.W.3d 904, 915 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011) (orig. proceeding). Thus, an appellate court has jurisdiction only from a final judgment of conviction, an appealable order, or when expressly granted by law. See Abbott, 271 S.W.3d at 696\u201397; see generally TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 44.02; TEX. R. APP. P. 25.2(a)(2).Exceptions to the general rule include: (1) certain appeals while on deferred adjudication community supervision, Kirk v. State, 942 S.W.2d 624, 625 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997); (2) appeals from the denial of a motion to reduce bond, TEX. R. APP. P. 31.1; McKown v. State, 915 S.W.2d 160, 161 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1996, no pet.); and (3) certain appeals from the denial of habeas corpus relief, Wright v. State, 969 S.W.2d 588, 589 (Tex. App.\u2013Dallas 1998, no pet.); McKown, 915 S.W.2d at 161. There is no appealable order currently before the Court; therefore, we lack jurisdiction over the matter. The Court, having examined and fully considered the notice of appeal, motion to dismiss and the documents on file, is of the opinion that we lack jurisdiction over the 2 appeal. See Abbott, 271 S.W.3d at 696\u201397. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. L. ARON PE\u00d1A JR. Justice Do not publish. TEX. R. APP. P. 47.2(b).

    "text": "NUMBER 13-24-00129-CR COURT OF APPEALS THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS CORPUS CHRISTI \u2013 EDINBURG DAVID TORRES, Appellant, v. THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee. ON APPEAL FROM THE 148TH DISTRICT COURT OF NUECES COUNTY, TEXAS MEMORANDUM OPINION Before Justices Silva, Pe\u00f1a, and Cron Memorandum Opinion by Justice Pe\u00f1a Appellant David Torres appeals his conviction for continuous sexual abuse of a child under 14 years of age, a first-degree felony. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.02. The jury sentenced Torres to fifty years\u2019 imprisonment. By one issue, Torres argues that the trial court erred in permitting the complainant, E.M. 1, to testify that she wished Torres to be sentenced to forty-five years\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm. I. BACKGROUND On June 2, 2022, a Nueces County grand jury indicted Torres with one count of continuous sexual abuse of a child under 14 years of age (Count 1), and two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child (Counts 2 and 3). See id. \u00a7\u00a7 21.02, 22.021. The indictment alleged that Torres committed various acts of sexual assault against a child, E.M., from on or about September 19, 2015, through February 1, 2016. The evidence adduced at trial showed that Torres was the \u201csignificant other\u201d of E.M.\u2019s grandmother, whom E.M. considered as her mother. At the close of evidence, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to Count 1, and the State dismissed Counts 2 and 3. During the punishment phase of trial, the State asked E.M., \u201cWhat are you asking this jury for?\u201d Trial counsel objected before E.M. responded, but the trial court overruled the objection. E.M. answered: \u201cForty-five years.\u201d Trial counsel renewed his objection to this testimony as not \u201cappropriate,\u201d asking that the trial court strike the response and grant a mistrial. The trial court overruled trial counsel\u2019s objection, and the jury sentenced Torres to fifty years\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. Matew v. State, 655 S.W.3d 291, 300 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg 1 To protect the identity of the complainant, we will refer to her by her initials. See TEX. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 30(a)(1) (providing that a crime victim has \u201cthe right to be treated . . . with respect for the victim\u2019s dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process\u201d). 2 2022, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Casey v. State, 215 S.W.3d 870, 879 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision lies outside the zone of reasonable disagreement. Id. (citation omitted); see Zuliani v. State, 97 S.W.3d 589, 595 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (noting that an abuse of discretion occurs \u201conly when the trial judge\u2019s decision was so clearly wrong as to lie outside that zone within which reasonable persons might disagree\u201d (citation omitted)). For non-constitutional error, as asserted here, we apply Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.2(b) and disregard the error if it did not aff",

See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.021(A). By his sole issue on appeal, Cortina argues that the trial court erred by denying his application for writ of habeas corpus due to ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm. I. BACKGROUND On June 1, 2013, Cortina was arrested on charges of continuous sexual abuse of a young child, two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child, and two counts of sexual assault. See id. \u00a7 22.021. He was indicted on February 27, 2018, and released on bond. On January 18, 2024, pursuant to a plea agreement, Cortina pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child. The State dismissed the remaining charges, and the trial court deferred adjudication and placed Cortina on community supervision for ten years. Thereafter, Immigration and Customs Enforcement took Cortina into its custody, and Cortina is currently pending removal. On April 3, 2024, Cortina filed an application for writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 11.072. According to Cortina, because his trial counsel failed to advise him \u201cthat as a direct consequence of his plea he would automatically be subject to deportation/removal from the United States . . . his plea of guilty was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered.\u201d The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Cortina\u2019s application for writ of habeas corpus. Cortina\u2019s trial counsel, Cortina, and Cortina\u2019s wife Stephanie Cortina testified at the habeas hearing. Trial counsel testified that Cortina was facing up to life imprisonment and that Cortina\u2019s \u201cprimary focus\u201d was to stay out of prison. Although Cortina was concerned about his immigration consequences, trial counsel reiterated that Cortina\u2019s primary goal was to avoid a prison sentence. Trial counsel admitted that he \u201chad no reason to believe [Cortina] was going to be picked up by the federal government.\u201d The trial court stated that Cortina attended twenty-three different hearings, and it \u201ctalked to him about the consequences\u201d of his guilty plea \u201cmore than once.\u201d Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201cI talked to him about it and I was very clear when I talked to him 2 about it. Not once but a couple of times I talked to him about the immigration consequences [of pleading guilty,] and he understood. He didn\u2019t say, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Cortina testified that before he entered his guilty plea, he asked trial counsel at least four times if it would affect his immigration",

A/K/A FRANCISCO GOMEZ TAYLOR JR., A/K/A FRANCISCO GOMEZ TAYLOR A/K/A FRANK TAYLOR GOMEZ JR., Appellant, v. THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee. ON APPEAL FROM THE 404TH DISTRICT COURT OF CAMERON COUNTY, TEXAS MEMORANDUM OPINION Before Justices Silva, Pe\u00f1a, and Cron Memorandum Opinion by Justice Pe\u00f1a Appellant Francisco Taylor Jr., a/k/a Francisco Gomez Taylor Jr., a/k/a Francsico Gomez Taylor, a/k/a Frank Taylor Gomez Jr. (Taylor), appeals his conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a second-degree felony, for which the trial court sentenced him to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.02(a)(2). By one issue, Taylor argues that the trial court erred when it permitted the State to amend its indictment without granting him a ten-day continuance pursuant to Article 28.10 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 28.10. We affirm. I. BACKGROUND On September 15, 2021, a Cameron County grand jury indicted Taylor with one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Count 1), and one count of assault causing bodily injury against a family member, enhanced by a prior conviction for family violence (Count 2). Count 1 of the indictment alleged that on February 8, 2021, Taylor caused bodily injury to Jane by \u201chitting [her] in the face with a brick, and [Taylor] did then and there use or exhibit a deadly weapon, [namely]: a brick, during the commission of the assault.\u201d Count 2 alleged that on that same date, Taylor, with whom Jane had a dating relationship, \u201cpunch[ed] [her] in the face,\u201d and had been previously convicted of family violence in Cameron County in 2006. The indictment contained two enhancement paragraphs, alleging a prior felony conviction for burglary of habitation and assault involving family violence. On November 8, 2022, the State filed a motion to amend the indictment, with a jury trial set to begin on November 14, 2022. On November 14, 2022, the trial court took up pre-trial matters before bringing in the jurors to begin voir dire, including the State\u2019s motion to amend the indictment. The State explained to the trial court the need to amend the indictment because it was not clear that the weapon used was a brick, as opposed to a 2 bat or some other unknown object. Trial counsel objected to the amendment, arguing that the trial court must wait ten days to begin trial pursuant to Article 28.10 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. The State then suggested to the trial court that the trial be reset for Wednesday November 16, 2025, so that Taylor could have the ten days. Trial counsel agreed to continue the trial until November 16, 2025. On November 16, 2025, with the jurors again ready to begin voir dire, trial counsel renewed her objection to the start of trial, noting that the State\u2019s calculation of the tenth day on which to start trial was incorrect, and t",
